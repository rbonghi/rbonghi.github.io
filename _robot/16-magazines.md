# Panettone

It's a robot from sold by DeAgostini in newsstand (2002), but the real name  of this robot was "Costruisci e programma il tuo robot". A robot in collaboration between Parallax Inc. This robot with different sensors and a little arm, was for me the first step in my robotics studies.

My second commercial robot bought in newsstand during 2004. This little robot compare with Panettone was designed by Eaglemoss, and with different expansion boards, could be interact with the environment. A big remote control with a LCD could receive information about the state of the robot.
