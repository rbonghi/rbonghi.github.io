The Infineon Larix 5 use an open source IMU using standard interfaces/connectors to work with any commercial Engine Speed Control (ESC) and Radio Control (RC). All software is used for academic education in several universities and hosted from [MCI Innsbruck](https://www.mci.edu/en/).

All code is available also on [github](https://github.com/ManagementCenterInnsbruck/InfineonMulticopter_LARIX).
