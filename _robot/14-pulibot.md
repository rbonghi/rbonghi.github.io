Was my first robotic exercise for my mother, in far far away on 2004 only one commercial robot was available to clean an house. Risen of ashes of Zippy, It was built to clean rooms with a cloth mounted in front of the robot. This robot was very stupid and all time the robot wandered and slammed on all walls, but Pulibot was a funny robot!
