I enjoy sports, with Kite surfing and CrossFit being my favorites. I'm relatively new to this world, having only two years of experience. Yes, I'm a bit of a nerd, and I didn't participate in many sports before. ðŸ˜„

Why not leverage my experience in robotics to enhance the equipment I have! Below is a list of the tools and designs I've created for sports.
