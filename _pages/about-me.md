I am the developer relations manager for AI & Robotics at NVIDIA. Since 2015, I have been an NVIDIA Jetson Champ designing multiple ROS/ROS-based robots for outdoor navigation and educational applications. Additionally, I have been involved in developing AI solutions for numerous international clients in the retail and robotics space.

I got a Ph.D. in control theory and industrial automation, with a deep focus on robotics.
