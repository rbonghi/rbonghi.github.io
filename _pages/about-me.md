 was born in 1986 in Rome, Italy and I’m a Ph.D. in System Engineer. I’ve long experience in robotics, both for academic carrier and hobby, let I’ve gained a significant skill in this field from my experiences in different kind of robotics.

I’m graduated with honor in “Automation and system engineering” in 2012 at University of Sapienza in Rome with a thesis on: “An autonomous mobile platform in a augmented reality”. The different components designed and built for the platform are described in details with emphasis on the various steps of the project implementation, the control systems and the supervisory control program, which make possible the simulation of the platform performance.

Now I’m a Ph. D. in Automation focused on “Non linear digital control applied in robotics”. I’ve built different autonomous platform for robotics suitable for exploration, “DUDE”, “Panther”.
