Robots are typically equipped with cameras. When designing a digital twin simulation, it’s important to replicate its performance in a simulated environment accurately.

However, to make sure the simulation runs smoothly, it’s crucial to check the performance of the workstation that is running the simulation. In this blog post, we explore the steps to setting up and running a camera benchmark on your workstation on NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
