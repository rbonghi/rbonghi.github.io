**Date:** Wednesday, October 26, 2022
**Time:** 10:00 - 12:30 CEST
**Duration:** 2.5 hours

Robots are becoming more ubiquitous for daily life usage, from smart automation in manufacturing to robots in last-mile delivery for consumers. However, industrial and commercial robotics development can be complex, time consuming, immensely challenging, and expensive. Unstructured environments across many use cases and scenarios are also common.

The NVIDIA Isaac™ robotics platform can address these challenges with an end-to-end solution to help decrease costs, simplify development, and accelerate time-to-market. NVIDIA® Isaac ROS GEMs are hardware accelerated packages that make it easier for ROS developers to build high-performance solutions on NVIDIA hardware. This workshop will introduce various SDKs within NVIDIA Isaac™ Robotics platform and guides the developers with demonstration of end-to-end robotics development workflow. Also, learn about NVIDIA Inception, an NVIDIA-funded program designed to help startups evolve faster through access to cutting-edge technology and NVIDIA experts, connections with venture capitalists, and co-marketing support to heighten startup visibility. www.nvidia.com/inception
