Roboticists may benefit from using different simulators to perform different simulation tasks. During this webinar, we will move from an Ignition Gazebo simulation to Isaac SIM using the new Ignition-Omniverse experimental converter.

This webinar investigates all of the steps needed from a Gazebo to an Ignition Gazebo simulation and uses the Ignition Gazebo to Omniverse connector to drive your robot directly from Isaac SIM.

The talk will be based on the Isaac SIM tutorial, gz-Omni, sdformat repositories, and we will feature an end to end detailed example using the Jetson-powered Nanosaur.
