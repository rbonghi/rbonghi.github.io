We explore the idea of using a fully actuated design for an unmanned aerial vehicle developed for aerial manipulation. To this aim, a Trirotor equipped with a prismatic arm has been adopted. An accurate analysis of the mechanical design and modeling of the vehicle has been performed. Particular attention has been given to the analysis of the destabilization effects caused by the arm motion, during the vehicle flight.

A system control, able to stabilize the vehicle in different flight conditions, has been developed and implemented in a simulation platform, for verification and validation purposes.
