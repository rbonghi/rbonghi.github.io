November 18th, 2022

Last week I had a beautiful day at King's College London, presenting what you can do with NVIDIA robotics.
Thank you, Matteo Leonetti, for inviting me!

Starting from my university background (I'm a control theory engineer) to what I do now at NVIDIA Embedded and exploring all robotics software (Isaac SIM Isaac ROS, NVIDIA Jetson, ...).
