**Talk**: Accelerating Robotics with NVIDIA Isaac ROS [A31574]

Develop new features and increase the capabilities of your robot using new Isaac GEMs for ROS packages. These open-source ROS2 packages will accelerate perception from the camera through deep learning inference, unlocking intelligent robots with edge AI. With new ROS2 packages to leverage hardware accelerators built into NVIDIA Jetson, see how Isaac ROS can help with image processing, object detection and tracking, visual odometry, and AprilTag pose estimation. We'll briefly demonstrate how to integrate these Isaac GEMs for ROS on a robot named Nanosaur.
