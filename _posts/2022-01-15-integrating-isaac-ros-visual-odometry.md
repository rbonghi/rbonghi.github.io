Using [NVIDIA Isaac ROS GEMs](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros-gems) in a Docker container, we will investigate and design a robotics application using the Isaac ROS Visual Odometry GEM known for its industry-leading accuracy. This will be implemented with two stereo cameras: Intel RealSense and Stereolabs ZED. In this webinar hosted by NVIDIA's Raffaello Bonghi, we'll take a deep dive on NVIDIA Jetson ROS Docker containers showing how to incorporate DevOps principles to your robotic application workflow. The talk will be based on the Nanosaur, the smallest open-source, fully 3D-printable NVIDIA Jetson robot based on ROS2 & Isaac ROS.

In this webinar you will learn: 
* Learn how to design a robotics application using Isaac ROS Visual Odometry with stereo cameras such as Intel RealSense and Stereolabs ZED.
* Take a deep dive on NVIDIA Jetson ROS Docker containers showing how to use your Jetson in DevOps with Github Actions.
* We will highlight building a Nanosaur, the smallest open-source, fully 3D-printable NVIDIA Jetson robot based on ROS2 & Isaac ROS.
