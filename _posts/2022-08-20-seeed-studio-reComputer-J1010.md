In this review on the [Seeed Studio reComputer J1020](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-H0-p-5335.html), a robust box with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a custom carrier with extra RTC socket, M.2 KEY E and M.2 KEY M connector extra.

**:warning: WARNING** *reComputer Jetson-10-1-A0* has changed to *reComputer J1010*
{: .notice--warning}

Seeed Studio also sells different solutions of the same reComputer J10 series:
* [reComputer J1010](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-A0-p-5336.html)
* [reComputer J1020](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-H0-p-5335.html)

# Product overview

The [Seeed Studio reComputer J1020](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Jetson-10-1-H0-p-5335.html) appears in a nice black carton package where the Aluminum case is cushioned by foam.

{% include gallery id="reComputer-box" caption="Seed Studio reComputer J1020 box" %}

The package includes a box with the 12V power adapter and a complete set of power adapters to use the reComputer in all countries.

List of components:
* NVIDIA Jetson Nano module
* Seeed reference carrier board
* Passive aluminum heatsink
* Aluminum case
* 12V power adapter

This box looks pretty nice and safe for transport. I liked the engraved logo when you opened the package.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO** If you want to see a review of the unboxing, open my [üì∏ robo.panther](https://www.instagram.com/robo.panther/) instagram account and watch my [üéûÔ∏è **reel**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cg4t5ZSlNfa/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)
{: .notice--primary}

## Main features

* **Hand-size edge AI device** built with NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB Production Module, with onboard rich IOs including Gigabit Ethernet port, USB 3.0 & USB 2.0 ports, HDMI port, and SD card slot.
* **128 NVIDIA CUDA¬Æ cores deliver 0.5 TFLOPs (FP16)** to run AI frameworks and models for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing.

* **Incredibly power efficient**: powered by Type C 5V/3A, consuming as little as 5 watts.
* **Expandable** with the onboard interfaces and reComputer case, able to mount on the wall with mounting holes on the back.

# reComputer J1020

The box looks pretty solid and well-designed. Inside the Aluminum case are assembled on the Seeed Studio custom developer board the NVIDIA Jetson Nano module with heatsink, same of the official NVIDIA Developer Kit.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/review/reComputerJ1020/seeedstudio-reComputerJ1020-open.jpg" alt="Aluminum case opened with NVIDIA Jetson Nano" caption="The aluminum case opened with NVIDIA Jetson Nano" %}

In the second box is available a 12V power supply with all adapters, for all main countries, such as:

| Plug   | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| Type-A | USA, Japan, Canada, Mexico |
| Type-C | Europe, Asia and South America |
| Type-E | Europe |
| Type-G | UK | 
| Type-I | India | 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/review/reComputerJ1020/seeedstudio-12vpower-adapter.jpg" alt="12V power adapter and adaptors" caption="12V power adapter and adaptors" %}

This power supply works with a 100-240V input with an output of 12V at 2A continuous. This power AC/DC adapter has a power jack output that fits with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano custom carrier board.

## Aluminum case

The Aluminum case is pretty solid and straightforward to use a Jetson Nano for server application or AI.

Something that I notice is beneficial is the double rubber feet, one the case basement and another side on a side. This solution gives this NVIDIA Jetson box a stable solution if you don‚Äôt have enough space on your desk. Moreover, there are four holes for a wall mount.

Another nice thing is a button below the box to open and access the NVIDIA Jetson. Four magnets attach to the cover and are released only by pressing this button.

{% include gallery id="reComputer-case" caption="Seed Studio reComputer J1020 parts" %}

In the two pictures below, you can notice how the reComputer case is made.

There are different threaded holes for different carrier boards or devices. This is a good solution if you want to use this case for other carrier boards or if you want to design something from scratch.

{% include gallery id="Aluminum-case" caption="Aluminum case details" %}

This case offers on the other side of rubber feet four through holes to pass cables from the NVIDIA Jetson outside the case. For example, if you have buttons, I2C sensors, or others.

I suggest that NVIDIA Jetson Nano not use the cover and make it possible to plug an extra fan on the Jetson heatsink.

This aluminum case is also fit for an [NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX](https://rnext.it/review/nvidia-jetson-xavier-nx/) board. In this case, you don‚Äôt need to modify anything; the heatsink already has a little fan.

## Carrier board

The Seeed Studio reComputer J1020 offers an excellent custom carrier well design. In addition, it looks like to have on your hands an official NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer kit.

The size and the screw holes are in the same position as the official NVIDIA Jetson Nano Dev Kit.

{% include gallery id="seeedstudio-carrier" caption="Seeed Studio NVIDIA Jetson Nano custom carrier board" %}

This custom carrier (model J1020) offers different extra connections compared to an official carrier board. For example, in the pictures below, you can notice:
* M.2 KEY M
* M.2 KEY E (disabled)
* RTC socket (battery not included)
* Fan header (different connector)
* Optional PoE backpower header
* DC Barrel jack 9V-19V (The official DevKit needs only 5V input)

{% include gallery id="reComputerJ1020-connections" caption="Seeed Studio carrier board connections" %}

Compared to the official Developer Kit, this carrier reComputer J1020 uses an NVIDIA Jetson Nano module, which works with a 16Gb eMMC memory instead of an SDcard slot. Still, if you need extra space, you can use an M.2 KEY M and plug in an SSD NVMe card to have extra space.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO** This NVIDIA Jetson has already installed the **Jetpack 4.6**. So you can use it directly when you power on the system.

# Install on SD card

Here we are!

Suppose you want to install the latest NVIDIA Jetpack on the Jetson Nano. In that case, you can follow the guidelines suggested by Seeed Studio, [Install NVIDIA System based on Seeed Carrier Board](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/install_NVIDIA_software_to_Jetson-10-1-A0/#flashing-to-emmc-with-command-line).

In the first step, you need an SSD NVMe, or you can use the [128GB NVMe M.2 PCle Gen3x4 SSD](https://www.seeedstudio.com/M-2-2280-SSD-128GB-p-5332.html) and plug it like the picture below. Remember to find and screw an M1 to hold the memory. Usually, this screw is not included when you buy an NVMe memory, and the Seeed Studio reComputer doesn‚Äôt include extra screws.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/review/reComputerJ1020/NVIDIAJetson-Nano-seeedstudio-carrier-SSD.jpg" alt="Install SSD card on Seeed Studio  Jetson Nano custom carrier" caption="Install SSD card on Seeed Studio  Jetson Nano custom carrier" %}

Second stage you need to install on your Desktop the NVIDIA SDK Manager.

**:warning: WARNING** The latest NVIDIA Jetpack for NVIDIA Jetson Nano need **Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04** or x86 system.
{: .notice--warning}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/review/reComputerJ1020/installSSD.png" alt="Install Jetpack on SSD" caption="Install Jetpack on SSD" %}

## Assemble rootfs

Open the command line of your host machine and write:

```
tar xf ${L4T_RELEASE_PACKAGE}
cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/
sudo tar xpf ../../${SAMPLE_FS_PACKAGE}
cd ..
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh
```

where:
* `L4T_RELEASE_PACKAGE` is the Linux for Tegra folder
* `SAMPLE_FS_PACKAGE` is the Tegra Linux sample root file system you downloaded from NVIDIA Jetpack website

## Flash system on Jetson

Now you need only to flash the NVIDIA Jetson Nano with SSD following the command below:

```
sudo ./flash.sh ${BOARD} mmcblk0p1
```

where `BOARD` is the board connected. For more info, check [this document](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/install_NVIDIA_software_to_Jetson-10-1-A0/#jump2).

**:warning: WARNING** Remember to plug the carrier board in force recovery mode.
{: .notice--warning}

Example for the NVIDIA Jetson Nano devkit with emmc the command will be:

```
sudo ./flash.sh jetson-nano-devkit-emmc mmcblk0p1
```

After the script format and install the Jetpack, the NVIDIA jetson will be ready to use!
