# reComputer J1020

The box looks pretty solid and well designed. Inside the Aluminium case are assembled on the Seeed Studio custom developer board the NVIDIA Jetson Nano module with heatsink, same of the official NVIDIA Developer Kit.

In the second box is available a 12V power supply with all adapters, for all main countries, such as:

| Plug   | Countries |

| Type-A | USA, Japan, Canada, Mexico |
| Type-C | Europe, Asia and South America |

{% include figure image_path="/assets/review/reComputerJ1020/seeedstudio-12vpower-adapter.jpg" alt="12V power adapter and adaptors" caption="12V power adapter and adaptors" %}

This power supply works with an 100-240V input with an output of 12V at 2A continuous. This powers AC/DC adapter have a power jack output that fit with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano custom carrier board.

## Aluminum case

The Aluminum case is pretty solid and really simple to use a Jetson Nano for server application or AI. 

Something that I notice really useful is the double rubber feet, one the case basement and another side on a side. This solution give to this NVIDIA Jetson box a stable solution if you don't have enough space on your desk.

Another nice thing is a button below the box to open and have access to the NVIDIA Jetson. The cover is attached by four magnets and only pressing this button the cover is released.
