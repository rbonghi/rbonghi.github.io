## Difference between Nano 4Gb & 2Gb

The NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB is an excellent entry-level Jetson board. 

I was surprised when I switched on in my first time, for the speed by LXDE desktop environment I used for few days like and home media centre, running video, browsing with chromium and writing with the text editor few notes.
Compare Unity, the speed and the performance of LXDE on a Jetson Nano 2GB are the same or better than an NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB.

I really appreciated being able to take advantage of the qualities of the LXDE graphics compared to Unity for the low memory consumption and the speed of response.
Compared to the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4Gb with Unity, disable the desktop and work only with the command line, did not present big performance differences.

The only personal negative point, I did not use before the LXDE desktop and I spent a lot of time finding all simple application to work with it.

Another interesting note is the Code Name evolution, we are following the names of actors or plants in the last Star Wars trilogy. Yes is silly, but NVIDIA engineers for this family of board use characters in Star Wars! 🙂 

{% include gallery caption="Star Wars code names **Porg** and **Batuu**" %}

When have seen in the Jetson Xavier NX the code name was Jakku the homeworld of the scavenger Rey.
Now the **Jetson Nano 2Gb** code name **Batuu**. It was a remote terrestrial [planet](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet) on the edge of the [galaxy](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy)‘s [Outer Rim Territories](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim_Territories), in the [Batuu system](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Batuu_system) of the [Trilon sector](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trilon_sector). (more details in [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Batuu))

The Jetson Nano 4Gb is the Porg were a species of sea-dwelling bird. They were native to the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker made his exile in the years prior to the Battle of Crait. More info from [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Porg)

# Jetson AI Certification Programs

The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) is launching the NVIDIA Jetson AI Certification Program, a series of hands-on self-paced educational tutorials, video walkthroughs, and project-based assessments aimed at educators and learners. The Jetson AI Fundamentals course teaches the fundamentals of training/inference workflow, data collection, and real-time computer vision. It covers classification and regression networks, along with object detection and semantic segmentation.

## Jetson Community Projects
There are amazing NVIDIA Jetson projects available, yes, sure, I kindly suggest first for all my jetson-stats to read the status of your board, but as well there are other friends that are made really cool projects, below I list some projects that I suggest:

| Project | Image | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **jetson-stats**<br/>by [Raffaello Bonghi](http://rnext.it/) | ![[jetson-stats]](https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats/wiki/images/jtop.gif) | Jetson-stats is a package to monitoring and controls your NVIDIA Jetson [Xavier NX, Nano, AGX Xavier, TX1, TX2] Works with all NVIDIA Jetson ecosystem. When you install jetson-stats are included:<br/>-[jtop](https://pypi.org/project/jetson-stats/#jtop), [jetson_config](https://pypi.org/project/jetson-stats/#jetson_config), [jetson_release](https://pypi.org/project/jetson-stats/#jetson_release), [jetson_swap](https://pypi.org/project/jetson-stats/#jetson_swap), [jetson variables](https://pypi.org/project/jetson-stats/#jetson_variables) |
| **Fever control with Jetson Nano & Lepton3**<br/>by [Walter "Myzhar" Lucetti](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/www.myzhar.com) | ![Jetson Fever control]({{ '/assets/review/NVIDIA-jetson-nano-2gb/community-fever_control_lepton3.jpg' | relative_url }}) | A useful application for the COVID19 era to control the human temperature and issue alarms in case of fever. This year, the year of COVID19, I decided to get that project out of the drawer and to adapt it to Nvidia Jetson Nano to realize an application to control human body temperature and issue alerts in case of fever. |
| **Real-time human pose estimation** | ![realtime pose estimation]({{ '/assets/review/NVIDIA-jetson-nano-2gb/realtime-pose-estimation.png' | relative_url }}) | This project features multi-instance pose estimation accelerated by NVIDIA TensorRT. It is ideal for applications where low latency is necessary. It includes:<br/>– Training scripts to train on any key point task data in MSCOCO format<br/>– A collection of models that may be easily optimized with TensorRT using torch2trt<br/>This project can be used easily for the task of human pose estimation or extended for something new.|
| **Recognizing sign language with Jetson Nano**<br/>by [Dennis Faucher](https://twitter.com/dennisfaucher) | ![Sign language]({{ '/assets/review/NVIDIA-jetson-nano-2gb/community-sign_language.png' | relative_url }}) | The Jetson Nano caches this model into memory and uses its 128 core GPU to recognize live images at up to 60fps. That high fps live recognition is what sets the Nano apart from other IoT devices. I have been hearing recommendations toward “Train in the cloud, deploy at the edge” and this seemed like a good reason to test that concept. Mission accomplished. |

# Benchmarks
Running inference benchmarks is easy with our benchmarking utility hosted at [jetson_benchmarks](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetson_benchmarks.git).
The utility provides a simple interface to run benchmarks.

Once the script starts, it will ask for a password two times, first for setting up the Jetson module in MAXN mode and second for setting jetson_clocks. The benchmarking will take a couple of hours and will run benchmarks on all the models. At the end, you will see benchmarking results similar to this:

|  | FPS | Model Name |
|--|-----|------------|
|0 | 10.6 | inception_v4 |
|1 | 10.0 | vgg19_N2 |
|2 | 15.3 | super_resolution_bsd500 |
|3 | 16.8 | unet-segmentation |
|4 | 14.5 | pose_estimation |
|5 | 47.6 | yolov3-tiny-416 |
|6 | 36.6 | ResNet50_224x224 |
|7 | 42.6 | ssd-mobilenet-v1 |
