The paper recalls the achievement of quasi-halo orbit following around the L2 translunar libration point via continuous-time nonlinear regulation and presents the corresponding sampled-data design by emulation. The paper also introduces a multirate sampled-data stabilizing control law for performing the same task.

Simulation results concerning two such sampled-data control strategies show that the latter sensibly improves the tracking performances compared to the former.
