You need or you broken your handle on your kiteboard. I made the repair kit also for that!
Compare all official kiteboard handles, this design is more robust and more handable compare the rest of the market!

This new handle use screw **M6x20cm**

In the picture below an example for a RRD kiteboard

In the gallery below the datasheets for different kiteboard, if you want one, drop me a message. I can customize the handle with everything you want! :smile:
