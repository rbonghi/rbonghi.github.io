A sleek and functional replacement for lost or worn screw caps on RRD twintip kiteboards. Designed to snap securely into place over the footstrap screws, these caps help protect your board from sand, salt, and water intrusion‚Äîkeeping your gear clean and extending the life of your inserts.

* Poison

And many others with standard screw layouts
